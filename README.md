# **IOT DEVICE REST API** ðŸª™ðŸª™

## **Project Description** 
  ðŸ”¸A shop in London has 2 million IoT tracking devices in the warehouse for sale, of which
half need to be configured to meet UK standards. A configured device will have a status
"READY" and an ideal temperature between (-25'C to 85'C).
The configuration process requires a given IoT device to be associated with a SIM
(Subscriber Identification Module) card. The SIM card holds information such as:
â€¢ SIM ID - uniquely identifies the SIM card.
â€¢ Operator code â€“ uniquely identify a mobile operator
â€¢ Country â€“ a country name, e.g. Italy
â€¢ Status â€“ device status can be Active, Waiting for activation, Blocked or
Deactivated.
The shop can sell a device only if it meets the UK government's industry standard.

# **Task**
  Using the Java programming language, develop a REST API that
  ðŸ”¹ Returns all devices in the warehouse that are waiting for activation.
  ðŸ”¹ Management endpoints that enable the shop manager to remove or update a device
     configuration status.
  ðŸ”¹ Retrieve a list of IOTDevice entities from the database based on a specified DeviceStatus and a temperature range (temValue1 to temValue2).
  ðŸ”¹ Expected response format should be in JSON.

# **ðŸ“ŒTechnical Sector**
   
   ðŸ”¹Using Actuators to check application health

   ðŸ”¹**Design Patterns**: a)Builder Design Pattern    
                          b)Singleton Design Pattern  

   ðŸ”¹Enums and Constants to ease the work & clean the code.

   ðŸ”¹Using Mappers
